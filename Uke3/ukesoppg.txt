Exercise 1
Wih n exercises
and p working threads
to devide the workload on the workers the calculation is n / p excercises per thread,
and n%p more jobs on one of the threads.
Example:
150 tasks devided on 8 workers =  18 jobs
150 % 8 = 6 more jobs on the last worker
(optional, on the 6 last threads: add 1 more job)

Exercise 2
15 TASKS
10min per by 1 worker
shortest time fo 4 workers to finish 15 tasks?
10+10+10+20 = 50 time

3 workers
10+10+10+10+10+10=60

Excersize 3

n n time
devided by
m workers
n/m
+ 1 if modula != 0
n%m devided by m workers so time is + 1
